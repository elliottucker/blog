<img style="float:right;" src="{filename}/images/me.jpg"</img> DevOps engineer at [Swrve](http://www.swrve.com) with billions of years sys admin and ops experience in all kinds of industries, from cool, to really dull.  Definitely at the cooler end of things at the moment and enjoying getting my hands dirty again with some interesting tech. 

Amateur photographer who doesn't get out nearly enough. I'm told that when I do, I can take the odd good pic, anything from landscapes to social documentary. Now and then I point a telescope at the sky.


You'll find me mainly on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/elliottucker) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107749209705509326553?rel=author). You'll find some of my pics on at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elliot_tucker).

Oh, and I'm a Brit, living in Ireland, with an ace wife and two fab kids.
